    // No change will occue in case of string, if we make changes in one  string it won't affect the second string.


    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];


    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(players, team);

    // if we make copy of array by assignment operator, then it will act as copy by reference

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    const team2 = players.splice();
    // or
    const team3 = [].concat(players);


    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread


    const team4 = [... players];


    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.age = 99;
    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const captain2 = Object.assgin({}, person, {number:99});
    console.log(captain, captain2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // const captain3 = {...person}; Not in JavaScript yet

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

      name :"Wes";
      age = 100;

        twitter:'@wesbos';

      }
    }

    console.log(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);   // Only one level copy  
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));    // Whole object copied without reference
